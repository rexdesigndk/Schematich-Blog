### Why not just use tailwind build-in colors?
The tailwind color system is awesome. But on larger projects you wanna be able to have the freedom to create your own. This method also enables you to support older browser that are outside the support of Tailwind. Which is why i started using this method, as i was able to use sass variables.

### The process
Let's start off with something easy. Like adding a primary color, something you'll need for every project you make.
#### Add the follwing media query to your main stylesheee
```
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) { 
}
```
#### Then add :root and the color variable we defined in our tailwind config file. 
```
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) { 
	:root {
    --primary: #7c3aed;
  } 
}
```
As you've probably noticed we've also wrapped the css variable in a media query. That's the prefer color scheme spec. Which reads what the user have set their os theme to. To start with we are simply creating the base theme, which is our light theme.

#### Go to your Tailwind.config.js and extend the colors with the variable we just created.
```
theme: {
  extend: {
  "colors": {
      "primary": "var(--primary)",
  },
}
```
Here we have extended the default tailwind color system with our custom properties color that we just created in our css file.   

### Let's finally add the dark theme
Now that we've set our base theme (light theme) we can finally create our dark theme.

#### Simply repeat what you did with the light theme but instead we replace light with dark
```
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { 
	:root {
    --primary: #7c3aed;
  } 
}
```
