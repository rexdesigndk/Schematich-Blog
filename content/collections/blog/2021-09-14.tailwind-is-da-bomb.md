It's been a really fun and challenging process putting this together, and I'm really proud of how it turned out. I wrote up a big post about "Designing Tailwind UI Ecommerce" that's worth a read if you're interested in the process behind putting together a new Tailwind UI product like this.

You can check out a bunch more interactive previews as well as screenshots of every single new example over at the Tailwind UI website.

If you like what you see, consider purchasing a license — it's the best way to support our work on Tailwind CSS and Headless UI and makes it possible for us to keep making these tools better and better.
